HOW THIS THRIFT SHOP WEBSITE WORKS ON THE INTERNET

1. When a user enters the website URL in a browser, the browser sends a request
   to a web server where the website is hosted.

2. The Domain Name System (DNS) converts the domain name into an IP address
   so that the browser can locate the correct server.

3. The web server responds by sending the website files such as:
   index.html, style.css, script.js, and shop.jpg to the browser.

4. The browser reads the HTML file to create the structure of the website,
   applies CSS for styling and layout, and runs JavaScript for interactivity.

5. JavaScript executes in the browser and handles dynamic behavior like:
   button clicks, form validation, DOM updates, and API data fetching.

6. The website is a client-side application and does not require a backend
   or database for basic functionality.

HOW THIS WEBSITE CAN BE HOSTED ONLINE

1. Since this is a static website, it can be hosted using free hosting services
   like GitHub Pages or Netlify.

2. All project files are uploaded to the hosting platform.

3. The hosting server makes the files available on the internet 24/7.

4. Any user with an internet connection can access the website using its URL.

5. Static hosting is fast, secure, and ideal for student projects.
